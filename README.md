# EIA 2019/2020
Development repository for the digital version of the Estonian Human Development Report 2019/2020

## Prerequisites

The digital version of EIA 2019/2020 is developed using completely open source R Bookdown package which allows to combine R statistical computing code with Markdown language to generate books and websites.

About R project: https://www.r-project.org <br>
Downloading R Studio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ <br>
Getting started with R Bookdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html <br>

Install R and follow the instructions above to get started with Bookdown.

## Required packages

EIA uses a number of different R packages to generate the variety of plots diagrams. To install these packages:

```
install.packages('bookdown')
install.packages('sf')
install.packages('raster')
install.packages('scales')
install.packages('tmap')
install.packages('svglite')
install.packages('showtext')
install.packages('plotly')
install.packages('ggwordcloud')
install.packages('wordcloud')
```

## Local development

For local development: 
* clone the git repository
* open the EIA_2019_digi.Rproj with RStudio.
* go to Build -> Configure Build Tools and define the local site directory where you want the site to be generated
* Click Build Website in RStudio


Note that this will build the Estonian version of the Report. English version is handled as a separate project and can be accessed under the 'en' folder.

## Notes on project architecture and overall workings

* Each chapter of the report is generated based on the corresponding .Rmd file
* Data required to generate the R plots is located in the 'data' folder
* Figures exported from R code are located in the 'exported figures' folder. As a default, exporting the figures has been turned off (that is, commented out with a # in the R code chunk of each figure)
* All the figures that are not generated with R and have been manually designed are located in the 'figures' folder
* The custom-designed (not Bookdown generated) print versions of the chapters are available in the 'print' folder
* The report usest Bookdown Gitbook Style (https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html) as a basis, but the styling has been heavily modified and overwritten with CSS (eia.CSS) and custom html code inserted into the .Rmd files.
* Note that the R code chunks for each R diagram may not necessariliy work independently when run separately from the report (e.g. they may use libraries or themes defined earlier on in the report, but not particularly in that code chunk)
* English version is generated as a separate project and is accessible under the 'en' folder. Make sure to check the site directories before building â€“ the directory for the english version has to be "estonian_version_location/en" (where 'estonian_version_location' is you site directory to the Estonian version).

## Contributing
