The Estonian Human Development Report is a biennially published collection of articles reflecting and interpreting the current socio-economic situation in Estonia and possible future developments.

Produced as a collaboration involving acclaimed scientists and experts, the in-depth report contributes to knowledge-based perspectives and policymaking, and helps make research accessible.

The Estonian human development reports follow the model of the international human development index and reports published by the United Nations.

The Estonian human development reports have been published since 1995, and since 2006, by the <a href="https://www.kogu.ee">Estonian Cooperation Assembly</a>. The digital version of the report uses open data and open source code.
